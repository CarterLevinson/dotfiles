# Vi Mode
#
# The vi mode allows moving around Alacritty's viewport and scrollback using the
# keyboard. It also serves as a jump-off point for other features like search and
# opening URLs with the keyboard. By default you can launch it using Ctrl Shift
# Space.
#
# Motion
#
# The cursor motions are setup by default to mimic vi, however they are fully
# configurable. If you don't like vi's bindings, take a look at the configuration
# file to change the various movements.
#
# Selection
#
# One useful feature of vi mode is the ability to make selections and copy text
# to the clipboard. By default you can start a selection using v and copy it
# using y. All selection modes that are available with the mouse can be accessed
# from vi mode, including the semantic (Alt v), line (Shift v) and block selection
# (Ctrl v). You can also toggle between them while the selection is still active.
#
# Search
#
# Search allows you to find anything in Alacritty's scrollback buffer. You can
# search forward using Ctrl Shift f and backward using Ctrl Shift b.
#
# Vi Search
#
# In vi mode the search is bound to / for forward and ? for backward search. This
# allows you to move around quickly and help with selecting content. The
# SearchStart and SearchEnd keybinding actions can be bound if you're looking for
# a way to jump to the start or the end of a match.
#
# Normal Search
#
# During normal search you don't have the opportunity to move around freely, but
# you can still jump between matches using Enter and Shift Enter. After leaving
# search with Escape your active match stays selected, allowing you to easily
# copy it.
